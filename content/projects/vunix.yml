title: Vunix â€” UI Toolkit for Nuxt 3 / Vue 3
description: >
  Open-source UI toolkit built with Vue and TailwindCSS, offering theme-driven components and utility-first styling (UnoCSS, WindiCSS, Tailwind).
  I designed it with full TypeScript support and Figma prototypes for seamless customization. Archived after Nuxt UI launch, but maintained as a reference and testament to clean theming architecture.
