title: DW UI â€” UI Library for Nuxt 2
description: >
  My first UI library for Nuxt 2, providing a lightweight design system and reusable components.
  It was used in production for major projects like Franprix, Etat Pur, and Tootbus, ensuring consistency and faster development.
  While less complete than Vunix, it marked an important step in building scalable front-end foundations.
